        <h2 id="headline">Concept of Climate Change</h2>

        <p>Climate Change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns as well as temporal
          conditions. Such
          shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s,
          human
          activities have been the main driver and cause of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels
          like
          coal, oil and gas.</p>

        <p>Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that acts like a blanket wrapped around the Earth
          that traps the
          sun’s heat into the atmosphere which causes the raising of temperatures.</p>

        <p>The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These gases
          come from
          using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down
          forests can
          also release carbon dioxide that will lead to the decreasing of the ozone layer. Agriculture, oil and gas
          operations are
          the major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are
          among the
          main sectors causing greenhouse gases.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Fuels</h2>
          <p>Coal, Oil and Gas are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75
            percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

          <p>As greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun’s heat. This leads to global warming and
            climate
            change. The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history due to a lot of carbon
            emissions that
            are being produced. Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns and disrupting the usual
            balance of
            nature. This poses many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth.</p>

          <p>Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most
            electricity is
            still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide that is
            responsible for
            the thinning of the ozone layer – powerful greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat.

            cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods. Mining and other industrial processes
            also release
            gases, as does the construction industry. Machines used in the manufacturing process often run on coal, oil,
            or gas; and
            some materials, like plastics, are made from chemicals sourced from fossil fuels.</p>

          <h2>Illegal Logging</h2>
          <p>Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when
            they are
            cut, release the carbon they have been storing. Each year approximately 12 million hectares of forest are
            destroyed
            because of deforestation. Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability
            to keep
            emissions out of the atmosphere. Deforestation, together with agriculture and other land use changes, is
            responsible for
            roughly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

      <h4 id="headline">Effects of Climate Change</h4>

      <div class="concept1">
        <p><span>Hotter temperatures</span></p>

        <p>As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface heat temperature. The last decade,
          2011-2020,
          is the
          warmest on record. Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one. Nearly all land areas
          are
          being
          seen as hot days and heat waves due the changes of the temperature. Higher temperatures increase heat-related
          illnesses
          and make working outdoors more difficult that affects our lifestyle.</p>

        <p><span>More severe storms</span></p>

        <p>Destructive storms have become more intense and more frequent in many regions. As temperatures rise, more
          moisture
          evaporates, which exacerbates extreme rainfall and flooding, causing more destructive storms. The frequency
          and
          extent
          of tropical storms is also affected by the warming ocean. Cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons feed on warm
          waters
          at the
          ocean surface.</p>

        <p><span>A warming, rising ocean</span></p>

        <p>The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. The rate at which the ocean is warming strongly
          increased over
          the past two decades, across all depths of the ocean. As the ocean warms, its volume increases since water
          expands as it
          gets warmer. Melting ice sheets also cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal and island communities.</p>

        <p><span>Loss of species</span></p>

        <p>Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on both land and in the ocean. These risks increase as
          temperatures climb. Exacerbated by climate change, the world is losing species at a drastic rate 1,000 times
          greater
          than at any other time in recorded human history. One million species are at risk of becoming extinct within
          the
          next
          few decades. Forest fires, extreme weather, and invasive pests and diseases are among many threats related to
          climate
          change.</p>

      <h4 id="headline">What are the solutions to climate change?</h4>

      <div class="concept2">
        <p>Climate change is already an urgent threat to millions of lives – but there are solutions and interventions
          that we can
          do in order for us to lessen or prevent the catastrophe from happening. From changing how we get our energy to
          limiting
          deforestation, here are some of the key solutions to climate change.</p>

        <p>The main ways to stop climate change are to pressure government and business to:</p>

        <p>- Keep fossil fuels in the ground and minimize the usage. Fossil fuels include coal; oil and gas, and the
          more
          that are
          extracted and burned, the worse climate change will get. All countries need to move their economies away from
          fossil
          fuels as soon as possible.</p>

        <p>- Invest in renewable energy. Changing our main energy sources to clean and renewable energy is the best way
          to
          stop using
          fossil fuels. Using renewable energy not only helps and saves us natural energy, but also helps the nature to
          be
          managed. These includes the use of technologies like solar, wind, wave, tidal and geothermal power.</p>

        <p>- Switch to sustainable transport. Petrol and diesel vehicles, planes and ships use fossil fuels that emits
          carbon
          emissions. Reducing car use, and switching to electric vehicles and minimizing plane travel will not only help
          stop
          climate change, it will reduce air pollution too.</p>

        <p>- Restore nature to absorb more carbon. The natural world is very good at cleaning up our emissions, but we
          need to look
          after it as well. Planting trees in the right places or giving land back to nature through ‘rewilding’ schemes
          is a good
          place to start. This is because photosynthesizing plants draw down carbon dioxide as they grow, locking it
          away
          in
          soils.</p>

        <p>- Protect forests like the Amazon. Forests are crucial in the fight against climate change, and protecting
          them
          is an
          important climate solution. Cutting down forests on an industrial scale destroys giant trees which could be
          sucking up
          huge amounts of carbon.</p>

        <p>- -Protect the oceans. Oceans also absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps to
          keep our
          climate stable. But many are overfished, used for oil and gas drilling or threatened by deep sea mining.
          Protecting
          oceans and the life in them is ultimately a way to protect ourselves from climate change.</p>

        <p>- Reduce plastic. Plastic is made from oil, and the process of extracting, refining and turning oil into
          plastic (or even
          polyester, for clothing) is surprisingly carbon-intense. It doesn’t break down quickly in nature so a lot of
          plastic is
          burned, which contributes to emissions.</p>
